# Getting started with Programming ROI

This document is a guide to getting started with programming the Roobot Over IP system. It is assumed that you have a basic understanding of the system, and have the necessary hardware and software to begin.

See here for getting started with an overview of the system or tools for programming:

-   [Overview of everything ROI](ROIAll.md)
-   [ROI programming tools](../Modules/Platformio.md)

We are assuming you are making a module from scratch, and the hardware is finished. See the electrical sub-team for help with hardware.

# 1. Make a new Module in PlatformIO

We need to start of by making a new module source tree. This refers to a folder in the `Modules` directory that contains all the code or configuration for a single module. This is done by copying the `Modules/Template` folder and renaming it to the module name.

It is helpful to `CTRL+SHIFT+n` open a new window of vs code and open the new module folder. This will automatically open the "project" in PlatformIO allowing for easy compilation.

Take note of the general structure of the `main.cpp`, the infra object holds everything else required for a ROI module to successfully operate. You have access to a moduleStatusManager, and a general buffer of approximately 64 bits in length (See Packet.h for specific length macro ROIMAXPACKETLENGTH). This buffer is helpful to reuse if you are short on memory. Note it is not empty, but when your code is running it can overwrite the buffer freely. If you want to develop your setup and looping functions now, go ahead and do so. Avoid making a generalPacketHandler() yet until we have defined the packet structures [step 2].

# 2. Defining communication macros/constants

ROI uses UDP packets for communication due to a multitude of reasons and hardware limitations. Whether it's to our benefit or detriment, these packets are stream of data with no pre-defined order or purpose. ROI chooses to limit this for the sake of simplicity. You do not send freeform data, but rather create a Packet object with certain fields. Then the infra object serializes and transmits this data. The major benefit is the ROI system serializes and deserializes the data for you, so wether you are writing module firmware or ROS nodes, you are interacting with the exact same data structure object.

The exact form of this henceforth known as general packet (another specialized one exists but don't worry about that) is:

-   Subdevice ID (16 bit unsigned integer). This is used to refer to a device within the module. An example is more helpful: a module that controls 2 motors will use 0 and 1 as subdevice IDs. This is used to differentiate between the two motors.
-   Action Code (16 bit unsigned integer). This is used to refer to a specific action that the subdevice should take. An example is: a go clockwise action for the motors in the previous example. Note, when possible action codes should be limited in scope. Make control more granular, don't have a single action code that does a sequence unless it is absolutely necessary. Having an action code that makes a motor run forward for 1 second and then stop and then run backwards for 1 second is entirely overcomplicated. Move that sequencing logic to the ROS node and send three separate action codes. Note that control loops are an exception to this rule. The trip latency of ROI means that ideal control systems should be implemented only in firmware. However this still lends itself to simple action codes, just more complex in resulting action.
-   Checksum (16 bit unsigned integer). This is a simple checksum of the data. It is used to verify the data was not corrupted in transmission. This is handled behind the scenes without developer intervention. Just letting you know it exists. Depending on ROI settings, a failed check may result in a packet being dropped. It is the ROS node's responsibility to resend the packet if necessary (more on that later).
-   Data Payload (1-ROIMAXPAYLOADLENTH(~58) bytes). This is held as an array of bytes for your reference. Some byte array to float methods are provided for your convenience when necessary (See floatCast.h) It is up to the developer what the payload structure is. The data supplements the action code such as: a goto position action code would be couple with a payload determining, in some units of your digression, to what position the motor should go to. In general keep the payload simple, and use small units. It is much less computationally intensive to send a distance in an integer value of millimeters than it is to send a float in meters.

Note the total general packet adds up to 64 bytes, the same length as the general buffer used to serialize the data...

We need to define these subdevice ids, action codes, and payload structure. Open the `ModuleCodec.h` and `CodecReadme.md` both located in the lib folder.

Take a second to read a few lines of each to familiarize yourself with the format.

I would recommend the following steps:

1. Add your module to the moduleTypes namespace in `ModuleCodec.h`
2. Add a new namespace for your module in `ModuleCodec.h`, preferably at the bottom of the file.
3. Define your packet functions and structure in words in the `CodecReadme.md` file.
4. Translate these into code in the `ModuleCodec.h` file. Note the descriptive types used within the file. These are used to make the code more readable and maintainable. They are not necessary, but are recommended.

# 3. Implementing the generalPacketHandler

Thankfully this step is some real programming. The only trickly bit is you must define your function before the construction of the infra object. Best practice would probably be using a separate file and including it. Otherwise, you can use some forward declarations or pointer tomfoolery.

Requirements for the generalPacketHandler:

1. be a function of return type ROIPackets::Packet (a reply packet)
2. accept 1 argument of type ROIPackets::Packet (the incoming packet)
3. fill out the reply packet with the appropriate data. The ROS node is expecting a reply packet containing the same subdevice and action code as that is how it ensures the command made a round trip. Best practice is to call the `.swapReply()` method on the incoming packet to create a reply packet with the correct subdevice and action code. This is not necessary, but is recommended.

The generalPacketHandler is called by the infra object when a packet is received. It is the developer's responsibility to handle the packet and return a reply packet. The infra object will handle the rest. Keep in mind you should keep in strict adherence to the packet structure defined in the previous step.
