Arduino Library: Ethernet2

## PlatformIO

### Libraries

Libdeps: any libs that exist outside of a platformio project are included into libdeps, but are NOT kept consistent. You will need to run platformio `FullClean` to remove all libdeps and then run `build` and platformio with pull the new libraries in. It's recommended to do these steps before flashing a module.
